# NLP with Transformers Visualizations

Welcome to the "NLP with Transformers Visualizations" GitHub repository! This project explores and elucidates the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using transformer models through rich visualizations and comprehensive descriptions.

#### Project Overview
Transformers have revolutionized how we handle text data, providing breakthroughs in various NLP tasks. This project aims to demystify the architecture of transformers and their application across different domains such as token classification, text summarization, and question-answering. Each module within this repository focuses on a specific application, illustrating how transformers can be adeptly applied to solve complex linguistic challenges.

#### Features
- **Detailed Architecture Visuals**: Dive into the intricacies of transformer models with detailed diagrams and flowcharts that break down the complex mechanisms into understandable parts.
- **Interactive Examples**: Experience transformers in action with interactive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate their capabilities in real time.
- **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Each visualization is accompanied by a thorough explanation, making the concepts accessible to both beginners and advanced practitioners.
- **Application-Specific Modules**: Explore dedicated modules for different NLP tasks, each tailored to show how transformers can effectively utilize that context.

#### Chapters :
- [Chapter 1: Introduction to NLP](chapter1.md)
- [Chapter 2: Text Classification](chapter2.md)
- [Chapter 3: Dive into Transformers](chapter3.md)


#### Tools and Technologies
This project utilizes popular NLP libraries such as Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, alongside visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to bring the concepts of transformers to life.
